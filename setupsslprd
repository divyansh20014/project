Steps to Set Up Server-Side SSL and mTLS Using PKCS#12
1. Generate the Server Keystore in PKCS#12 Format
The keystore holds the server's private key and public certificate, all stored together in a .p12 file.

Generate a Private Key and Self-Signed Certificate (for testing purposes)
You can generate a PKCS#12 keystore with a self-signed certificate using the following keytool command:

bash
Copy code
keytool -genkeypair -alias server -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore server.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -validity 3650
-alias server: The alias for the certificate.
-keystore server.p12: The keystore file name, which will be in PKCS#12 format.
-storetype PKCS12: Specifies the keystore type as PKCS#12.
-validity 3650: Validity period of the certificate (10 years).
You will be prompted for details such as:

Keystore password
Distinguished Name fields (Country, State, Organization, etc.)
Once completed, you will have the server keystore in PKCS#12 format (server.p12).

2. Export the Server’s Public Certificate (for the Truststore)
If you want to create a truststore that contains the server’s certificate (for example, to trust the server certificate from the client side), you need to export the server’s certificate from the keystore.

bash
Copy code
keytool -export -alias server -keystore server.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -file server.crt
This will export the public certificate of the server (server.crt), which can then be used to populate the truststore.
3. Generate the Truststore in PKCS#12 Format
The truststore contains certificates that the server will trust, such as the client certificate or the CA certificate that signed the client’s certificate.

Create the Truststore and Import the Server’s Certificate

To create a truststore in PKCS#12 format and add the server’s certificate:

bash
Copy code
keytool -import -file server.crt -keystore truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -alias server
server.crt: The certificate of the server (exported earlier).
truststore.p12: The truststore in PKCS#12 format.
-storetype PKCS12: Specifies the store type as PKCS#12.
When prompted, enter the password for the truststore.

Import the Client Certificate (for mTLS)

If you want your server to trust client certificates (for mTLS), you need to import the client’s public certificate into the truststore:

bash
Copy code
keytool -import -file client.crt -keystore truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -alias client
client.crt: The certificate of the client that the server will trust.
